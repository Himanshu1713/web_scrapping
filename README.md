# Flipkart web_scrapping
# Overview
This project involves web scraping data from Flipkart to gather information about mobile phones priced under â‚¹25,000. The data collected includes product names, prices, original prices, reviews, and descriptions. The scraped data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

# Technologies Used
# Python: 
The primary programming language used for web scraping.
# Pandas: 
A library used for data manipulation and analysis.
# Requests: 
A library for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
# BeautifulSoup: 
A library for parsing HTML and XML documents.

# Code Explanation
# Import Libraries: 
The script begins by importing the necessary libraries.

# Data Storage:
Empty lists are created to store the scraped data: product_name, price, original_price, description, and reviews.
# Web Scraping Loop:
A loop is used to iterate through multiple pages of the Flipkart search results.
# HTTP Request: 
The script sends a GET request to the Flipkart URL.
# Data Extraction: 
Using BeautifulSoup, the script parses the HTML and extracts relevant data.
# Data Validation: 
The script checks that all lists have the same length to ensure data integrity.
# DataFrame Creation: 
A Pandas DataFrame is created from the lists.
# CSV Export: 
The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
# Important Notes
# Compliance:
Ensure that web scraping complies with Flipkart's terms of service and legal guidelines.
# HTML Structure: 
The HTML structure of the Flipkart website may change over time, which could necessitate updates to the scraping logic.
# Pagination: 
The script currently scrapes data from pages 2 to 19. Adjust the range in the loop as needed to scrape additional pages.
# Future Enhancements
Implement error handling to manage potential issues during the scraping process.
Add functionality to scrape additional product categories or filters.
Enhance data cleaning and preprocessing before exporting to CSV.
